        <p>Welcome to our website! You can watch here visualizations of Finland's electricity
            production, consumption and import. 
            This website uses 
            <a id="link-to-fingrid-website" href="https://data.fingrid.fi/en/datasets">fingrid.fi</a>
            as the source of the data. 
            <br> <br>
            'Overview' button shows total production, total consumption and 
            total exportation (+ means export, - means import) of electricity in Finland. 
            <br> <br>
            'Renewability' button shows how much of total production is achieved
            via domestic wind, hydro or solar energy, which are the main 
            renewable energy sources in Finland. 
            <br><br>
            Please notice that you should also select a starting and
            ending date for the data visualization you want to do. 
            We visualize here data only in accurasy of days.
            So, for example, if it is 18th march and you want to see
            information of yesterday's electricity,
            you can select starting date: 17th march
            and ending date: 18th march.
